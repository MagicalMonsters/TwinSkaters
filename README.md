Game design:

There are two old airplanes, in middle of the scene, moving up (background is comming down).
Controls: 
up -> two planes get close to eachother
down -> two planes get far from eachother
left -> both planes go to left
right -> both planes go to right
Q -> left plane release water
E -> right plane release water

Background scene is a combination of forests and mountains (some parts of forests may be on fire)
The purpose is to stop as much fire as possible.
Fire will stop if a plane release water on top of it.
The water of the planes is limited.
The score of the player is based on the percentage of fire they stoped.
Also players should prevent colliding with the mountains (mountains work as obstacles)
